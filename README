i've decided not to rely on pure.css grid system by yahoo but make my own as it's been something on my to do list for a while. It would probably also be a good time to look into flexbox though perhaps expanding scope futher then production time will allow. It's been deemed not worth it time wise right now as the goal is to have a product by the end of the day. Spent half hour ish looking at flexbox resources.

###Resources
I like to attribute those who've helped me and to be honest keeping a list of where I found useful information with the project it was used on seems like a very good idea for current and future me.
