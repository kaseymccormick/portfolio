          <h2>Task</h2>
          <p>After being away for almost two years AIGA Nebraska sought out to bring back Me, Myself, and Design MMD for short, a student focused design conference, to it's yearly programming. I was voted on to organize and execute the event for 2016. The limitations I was given were: that it had to be in Lincoln, Nebraska, 45 minutes away from where I reside, or halfway in between Omaha and Lincoln. In addition the budget was set at $1200.00 prior to me joining. </p>
          <h2>Goals</h2>
          <p>With the experience of not only attending MMD in prior years but also been on the board I set a handfull of my own goals to help direct my decision making. They were as follows:</p>

            <li><b>Diverse speakers–</b> haven't spoken for AIGA Nebraska before, broad range of subjects, range in experience, gender, and other demographics.</li>
            <li><b>Diverse attendees –</b> univeristy and comunitiy College students, different years in schooling, and other other demographics. </li>
            <li><b>Inclusive food choices –</b> providing a variety of choices for attendees through out the day</li>
            <li><b>No additional costs –</b> mainly for parking, wanted the ticket to cover attende's needs for the day </li>
            <li><b>Reusable Logo –</b> years prior recreated a logo and accompanying materials each year, I wanted to have a logo that could/would be used year after year. </li>

          </ul>
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>  Me, Myself, and Design is a one day one track conference for student and emerging designers. Started in 2009
            it recently had lapsed due to several factors. I was voted onto the AIGA Nebraska board in March as chair of the event to focus on making
            it happen again and document the process. Held October 6th in Lincoln, Nebraska I arranged to have 3 speakers, one interactive talk, two panels and a portfolio
            review with my co chair. I focused on more communication and planning with speakers while she handled design and emails to our membership.
            After reading several articles about the tech industry, I made it a goal to have diversity at the conference, not only in speakers and content
            but reach for attendance. I succedded in doing so by working twords this goal from the start.
          </p>
          <div class="case-study__content__summary__quote">
            <p>From my point of view, MMD was a huge success. We had a good turnout, the audience was great, the pros were enthusiastic and presented killer material, the venue was amazing, and everything went off without a hitch, really— <em>especially</em> with it being two years since the last event. I was at that one, and for my money, this one was a big improvement. </p>
